# NSSL EFM Orientation Firmware

In the paddle opposite the motor driver, an orientation sensor based on a simple IMU  
provides rough data on the instrumentâ€™s orientation over time. This allows analysis  
of pendulum motion and other movements of the full instrument package. The system is  
designed for easy sensor replacement, and all orientation data are logged to a  
microSD card.

See the [main instrument repo](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/NSSL_EFM_Instrument)
for documentation and the rest of the instrument.
